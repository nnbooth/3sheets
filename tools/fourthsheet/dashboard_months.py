"""
dashboard_months.py — the home page's sample dashboard for every month, not just September.

The September dashboard comes from the driver-based model (financial_model.py, via publish_dashboard.py): full
profit and loss, balance sheet and cash flow, September against August. This builds the same dashboard for every
other month the data has (November 2024 to October 2026 to date), straight from the daily ledger and the operational
tables, using the model's own definitions for every headline number:

  - Profit and loss (income and expenditure): every month, from the ledger. Same lines and totals as September;
    lines that only exist in history (finished grants) are added in their section. The bottom line must equal the
    ledger for the month, or the build stops.
  - The fourth sheet: the same three headline numbers per organisation and the same chart, for that month against
    the month before. Where a number needs month-end balances (the not-for-profit's runway; the services firm's
    unbilled work) it is only shown from the opening balance, 31 July 2026, and says so before that.
  - Balance sheet and cash flow: the full statements exist for September 2026 (the month modelled end to end).
    Other months say so rather than invent balance-sheet history.

CHECKED: September built this way equals the model's September (every profit-and-loss line and every headline
number), so the two routes can't drift apart.

Writes data/dashboard-months.js (the list of months) and data/dashboard/<yyyy-mm>.js (one file per month, loaded
when someone picks it).
