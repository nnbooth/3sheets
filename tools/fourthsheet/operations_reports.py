"""
operations_reports.py — the questions that aren't about money: worked examples built from tools/operations.py's data.

  callbacks       SME trades    How long do customers wait for a callback?
  overtime        SME trades    Where is overtime creeping up, and why?
  people-helped   NFP           How many people did we help this month, and how many couldn't we reach?
  calls           NFP           When do calls for help come in, and are we there to answer?
  volunteers      NFP           How many volunteer hours go into each program?

Same shape as every other report (catalogue.py): headline numbers with workings, a month-by-month chart, a breakdown,
what it shows and what you'd do about it (flags, not instructions), and the data for the Excel download.
Each report is one organisation only.
