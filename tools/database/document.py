**Rules for every table**
1. **Surrogate keys**: an INT IDENTITY key on every dimension (`org_key`, `account_key`, ...); the source's own ID is kept as the business key with a UNIQUE constraint. Facts carry only surrogate keys.
2. **Unknown members**: every dimension has a −1 row ("Not applicable" / "Unknown"). Fact keys are NOT NULL.
3. **Grain first**: write each fact's grain in one sentence before building it (e.g. "one row per posting per day"). Never mix grains in one table.
4. **Type 2 history** where the past must stay as it was: rates, targets, customer regions, account mappings (`valid_from`, `valid_to`, `is_current`).
5. **Money as DECIMAL(19,4)**, one sign convention (income +, cost −, as the ledger), never floats. Percentages are calculated, not stored.
6. **Dates as `date_key` INT yyyymmdd** joined to dim_date; monthly facts use the month's first day. Role-playing dates get their own key columns.
7. **No derived tables**: anything that can be calculated from a fact is a view (or a DAX measure), so it can't drift.
8. **Status lives in `ops.period_status`**, written at month-end close, not in dim_date or the facts.
9. **Every row records its load** (`load_id` → ops.load_run), so any number can be traced to the file and run it came from.
10. **Performance and security**: clustered columnstore on the big facts (fact_gl, fact_time, fact_delivery_out); foreign keys on; row-level security on org_key once there's more than one client.

**Build order:** dim_date, dim_org → dim_account, dim_customer, dim_supplier, dim_carrier, dim_employee → dim_job, dim_engagement, dim_grant (+ program, funder) → fact_gl (with opening journals) → fact_time, fact_invoice → grants, deliveries, plans → rpt views (check each against today's tables: the statements must tie to the cent) → switch the report builder and Power BI to the views → retire the derived tables.

Ground rules for everything in this session:
1. Read before you write: inspect the source table(s) in `dbo` (columns, types, row counts, a few rows) first.
2. Never change, drop or delete anything in `dbo`, `ops` or `stage`. Build only in schema `star` (tables) and `rpt` (views);
   create those schemas if they don't exist.
3. Before creating anything, show me the DDL and the load query, and wait for my OK.
4. Dimensions: an INT IDENTITY surrogate key (`<name>_key`), the source ID kept as the business key with a UNIQUE constraint,
   a -1 'Unknown / Not applicable' row, and `valid_from`, `valid_to`, `is_current` where I say type 2.
5. Facts: surrogate keys only (NOT NULL, -1 for none), amounts DECIMAL(19,4) with the ledger's sign convention, `date_key` INT
   yyyymmdd joined to star.dim_date, a `load_id` column, foreign keys on, clustered columnstore on facts over 10,000 rows.
6. Anything that can be calculated from a fact is a VIEW in `rpt`, not a table.
7. After building, prove it: row counts and SUMs of every amount must equal the source in `dbo` (to the cent), and every
   foreign key must resolve. Show me the reconciliation query and its result. If anything doesn't tie, stop and tell me.
8. No dynamic SQL built from data values, no new logins or users, no permission changes.
