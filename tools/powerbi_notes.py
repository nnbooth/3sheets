powerbi_notes.py — a Power BI build PROMPT for each website report (for Claude with the Power BI MCP).

Writes OneDrive "Data documentation/Power BI/<report>.md" (internal notes, not site copy), generated
from the same report definitions as the website, so the two never drift. Each note covers the data
model, DAX measures, visuals section by section, the page slicer, drill-through to the workings,
data status, theme and export settings.

Run via tools/sample_data.py (after the reports are built).

COMMON_MODEL = """## Data model (shared)

Load from the cloud database (or the CSVs in `Data/`, one folder per task):

- **dim_date** (`Data/Common`): mark as the date table on `calendar_date`. Drill path: `financial_year` > `fy_quarter` > `month_name` > `week_start` > `calendar_date`. Sort `month_name` by `month_key`.
- **Month** (calculated table) for month-grain facts: `Month = SUMMARIZE(dim_date, dim_date[month_key], dim_date[month_name], dim_date[financial_year], dim_date[month_status], dim_date[month_locked_on])`. Relate `Month[month_key]` 1-to-many to `dim_date[month_key]`, and to each month-grain fact's `month_key`.
- **dim_org** (`Data/Common`) 1-to-many to every fact's `org_id`. Each report page filters to its organisation.
- Data status: `dim_date[day_status]` and `dim_date[month_status]` (Locked / Provisional / Incomplete) drive formatting and the "as at" card.

Relationships are single-direction, one-to-many from dimension to fact. Hide the key columns in report view.
"""

THEME = """## Theme and formatting

- Theme JSON colours: data colour 1 `#0E9F6E` (green: on target, lines, areas), `#A7B0B8` (grey: below target), `#2F2F2F` (target lines), text `#25342A`, muted `#5F6F63`.
- Bar charts: horizontal (categories down the left), data labels on, gridlines off, sorted by the page's default measure. Keep the sort fixed when the measure changes (sort by the default measure's column, not the visible one).
- Area charts: line 3 px, area transparency about 75% fading to the axis (Power BI has no gradient fill: approximate with transparency, or use a Deneb/Vega-Lite visual for a true fade), straight lines (no smoothing), y-axis on from zero with light gridlines, data labels off, markers only on the highest and lowest points (conditional marker formatting by a `IsMaxMin` measure).
- Numbers: whole dollars, percentages 1 decimal place, negatives in brackets. Gross margin is always labelled *gross margin* (before overheads, not profit). Wages always include on-costs.

EXPORT = """## Export and print

- Page size A4 landscape for PDF export. Put the business name and page name in a page header text box, and the file name, "Data retrieved <as at>" and page number in the footer (Power BI service: Export > PDF; or a paginated report for exact headers and footers).

Paste everything below into Claude with the Power BI MCP connected to the target model / report.

---

You are building {"one Power BI report page per business" if len([b for b in r["blocks"] if b.get("org")]) > 1 else "one Power BI report page"} that reproduces the website report "{r['question']}" (`report-{r['slug']}.html`) for {r['business']}. Use the Power BI MCP tools to create the model objects, measures and visuals. Work step by step and check each step before moving on.

**What the page answers:** {r['intro']}

**Rules (non-negotiable):**
- **One business per page.** The sample businesses (trades, services and the not-for-profit) are separate, unrelated organisations. Never add their numbers together, put them in one total, chart or table, or rank them against each other. Every page has a locked page-level filter on `dim_org[org_id]`, and every measure returns blank unless exactly one organisation is in view (`IF(HASONEVALUE(dim_org[org_id]), …)`, already written into the measures below).
- Gross margin is always labelled *gross margin* and never called profit: it is before overheads.
- Wages include their on-costs (super and leave). No payroll tax in the samples: both SMEs are under the Queensland threshold and the charity is exempt.
- Whole dollars; percentages to 1 decimal place; negatives in brackets.
- One slicer drives every visual on the page.
- Bars keep the same category order when the measure changes.

**Step 1: data model.**
{COMMON_MODEL.replace('## Data model (shared)', '').strip()}

**Step 2: measures.** Create these (adjust names to the model if tables are named differently, and tell me what you changed):

{guard_dax(MEASURES.get(r['slug'], ''))}

Then add `Org check = DISTINCTCOUNT(dim_org[org_id])` as a card on each page while you build: it must read 1 everywhere. Delete the card when the page is done.

**Step 3: visuals, top to bottom.**
{chr(10).join(secs)}

**Step 4: workings.** Add a drill-through page built on `kpi_workings` (`scope`, `subject`, `line_no`, `line`, `value`, `is_calculated`, `calculation`), filtered to the clicked item, lines in order, calculated lines in bold. Add a tooltip page for month points showing that month's inputs.

**Step 5: data status.** A card reading "September locked · October in progress" from `dim_date[month_status]`. Show locked months by default; the current month only where noted, lighter.

**Step 6: formatting.**
{THEME.replace('## Theme and formatting', '').strip()}

**Step 7: export settings.**
{EXPORT.replace('## Export and print', '').strip()}
