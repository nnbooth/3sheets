"""
model_rules.py — rules the sample numbers must always keep (site review, 9 Oct 2026). Run from the repo root:

    python3 -I tools/tests/model_rules.py .

  N1  time charged to the work + time not charged = technician wages (consultant salaries), every whole month,
      and the costing rate is wages ÷ available hours (people × working days × 7.6)
  N4  pay runs: (net pay + super) × pay runs in the month = cash paid to employees, every month with cash
  N5  balance sheets balance with GST payable, PAYG withholding payable, super payable and wages owed included
  N11 no money moves on a Saturday, Sunday or Queensland public holiday

Prints PASS or FAIL for each rule and exits 1 if anything fails. (When check_numbers.py arrives, these rules move into it.)
