"""
org_separation.py — prove the sample organisations are never mixed. Trades, services and the not-for-profit are
separate, unrelated businesses: no number, total, chart, ranking or working may combine two of them.

    python3 tools/tests/org_separation.py          (Windows: py tools\\tests\\org_separation.py)

Checks, from the data up:
  1. Data: every row in every organisation's folder carries that organisation's org_id; every fact row's account,
     job, engagement or grant belongs to the same organisation; ids and line names never repeat across organisations
     (so a database join or a Power BI slicer can't merge them).
  2. Reports, every period: each block of a report is one organisation, and its numbers tie to that organisation's
     own ledger (growth year to date is checked against each business alone, and must not equal the combined figure).
     Every working in a multi-business report names its business.
  3. Site: the growth card shows each business as its own group, and each group's headline ties to that business.
  4. Power BI prompts: one business per page, a locked org filter, and measures that go blank unless one org is in view.
Prints PROBLEMS: [] when everything passes (and exits 1 otherwise).
