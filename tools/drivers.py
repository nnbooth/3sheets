drivers.py — supporting files for every input that isn't a transaction.

The transactions (jobs, invoices, timesheets, ledger, grants, deliveries) are
already tables. This module writes tables for everything else the reports use,
so no number exists only in code:

  driver_month          headcount, wages, new customers, working days … by org and month
  cost_rate             costing rates, mark-ups, tax rate, payment terms
  target                every target line and threshold (margins, budgets, reserves, on-time bands)
  opening_balance       the balance sheet at 31 July 2026 that every balance starts from
  kpi_workings          each headline number and chart bar, line by line: inputs, results, calculation
  commentary            the notes and chart descriptions shown with the numbers
  dim_contract          maintenance contracts (fee, hours, materials, payment terms)
  dim_carrier           delivery carriers, in and out, and the regions they serve
  simulation_parameter  the rules used to invent the sample data (late rates, the planted stories, seeds)

Every table is checked against the model before it's written. Used by tools/sample_data.py.
