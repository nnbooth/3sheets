sync_media.py — keep everything under media/ identical between this machine and OneDrive.

The Excel downloads (and anything else git ignores) only live on the machine that built them,
so they're mirrored to OneDrive (Projects/The Fourth Sheet/Media/site media/), both ways:
whichever copy is newer wins, and files missing on one side are copied over. On a fresh
machine, running this pulls everything down.

Runs at the end of tools/sample_data.py, render_mockups.py and record_demo.py.
Run it yourself any time:   python3 tools/sync_media.py
